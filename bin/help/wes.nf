--cacheDir | /projects/omics_share/meta/containers | This is directory that contains cached Singularity containers. JAX users should not change this parameter.                                                                                         |
-w | /<PATH> | The directory that all intermediary files and nextflow processes utilize. This directory can become quite large. This should be a location on /fastscratch or other directory with ample storage. |

--sample_folder | /<PATH> | The path to the folder that contains all the samples to be run by the pipeline. The files in this path can also be symbolic links. 
--extension | .fastq.gz | The expected extension for the input read files.
--pattern | '*_R{1,2}*' | The expected R1 / R2 matching pattern. The default value will match reads with names like this READ_NAME_R1_MoreText.fastq.gz or READ_NAME_R1.fastq.gz
--read_type | PE | Options: PE and SE. Default: PE. Type of reads: paired end (PE) or single end (SE).
--concat_lanes | false | Options: false and true. Default: false. If this boolean is specific, FASTQ files will be concatenated by sample. This option is used in cases where samples are divided across individual sequencing lanes.

--gen_org | mouse | Options: mouse and human.
