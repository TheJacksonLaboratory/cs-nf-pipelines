Parameter | Default | Description

The following are human specific parameters. To see help for mouse, add `--gen_org mouse` to your command. 

--pubdir | /<PATH> | The directory that the saved outputs will be stored.
--organize_by | sample | How to organize the output folder structure. Options: sample or analysis.
--cacheDir | /projects/omics_share/meta/containers | This is directory that contains cached Singularity containers. JAX users should not change this parameter.
-w | /<PATH> | The directory that all intermediary files and nextflow processes utilize. This directory can become quite large. This should be a location on /flashscratch or other directory with ample storage.

--csv_input | /<FILE_PATH> | CSV delimited sample sheet that controls how samples are processed. The required input header is: patient,sex,status,sampleID,lane,fastq_1,fastq_2. See the repository wiki (https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/cs-nf-pipelines/wiki) for additional information. 

--xenome_prefix | /projects/compsci/omics_share/human/GRCh38/supporting_files/xenome/trans_human_GRCh38_84_NOD_based_on_mm10_k25| Xenome index for deconvolution of human and mouse reads. Used when `--pdx` is run. 
--pdx | false | Options: false, true. If specified, 'Xenome' is run on reads to deconvolute human and mouse reads. Human only reads are used in analysis. 

--quality_phred | 15 | The quality value that is required for a base to pass. Default: 15 which is a phred quality score of >=Q15.
--unqualified_perc | 40 | Percent of bases that are allowed to be unqualified (0~100). Default: 40 which is 40%.
--detect_adapter_for_pe | false | If true, adapter auto-detection is used for paired end data. By default, paired-end data adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled as the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, --detect_adapter_for_pe will enable it. Fastp will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.
