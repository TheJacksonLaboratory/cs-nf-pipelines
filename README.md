# Mouse Mutant Resource Structural Variant Detection

This repository holds a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) implementation of structural variant callers for both short-read Illumina based data, and PacBio CCS and CLR data. It was developed to provide results that are compatible with the [Mouse Mutant Resource Database](https://mmrdb.jax.org).
